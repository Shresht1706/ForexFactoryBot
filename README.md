## 💻 Development & Contribution

If you're a developer looking to contribute:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

4. Suggested tools:
   - Node.js `v18` or higher.
   - `nodemon` for local testing.

All event-fetching logic is cached via `cached_events.json` to reduce unnecessary API calls. Modify the scheduling logic (using `node-schedule`) to suit your timezones or trading habits.
